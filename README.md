## EPG Online

Environmental Politics and Governance (EPG) Online is a new webinar on environmental politics and governance. Building on the success of the annual [EPG conference](https://depts.washington.edu/envirpol/?page_id=1542), EPG Online is an online seminar series dedicated to showcasing the latest research on the political, institutional, and societal dimensions of environmental challenges from a variety of disciplines.

It remains unlikely that there will be a return to the usual speaker series and conferences this year. Thus, we hope that EPG Online can serve as a great meeting place for those interested in environmental politics and governance to share cutting edge research and keep in touch with and meet colleagues virtually.

### Time and Place

EPG Online seminars are generally held every two weeks on **Thursdays** 16:30 UK time (typically 8:30 West Coast, 11:30 East Coast, 17:30 Central Europe, 21:00 Delhi, 23:30 Beijing). Each seminar consists of two presentations with Q&As, each lasting 30 minutes.

The seminars are held online with Zoom. To receive the log-in information please sign up to the [EPG Online mailing list.](https://forms.gle/Xxbckc3DYu2EefE67)
